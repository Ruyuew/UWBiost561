Q1 C:Use more descriptive variable names. For instance, instead of i or j, use node_index or clique_candidate to indicate their roles in the algorithm. Include comments within the function to describe key steps, especially if the algorithm is complex.

# Load the UWBiost561 package

                                            clique_edge_density = 0.95)

# Run compute_maximal_partial_clique_master with a very small time_limit to force a timeout
set.seed(10)
result1 <- UWBiost561::compute_maximal_partial_clique_master(
  adj_mat = data$adj_mat, 
  alpha = 0.95, 
  number = 11, 
  time_limit = 2  # Set time_limit to 2 seconds to force a timed_out status

# Print the result to see the timed_out status
print(result1)

```

Q2 B:

1. Generating Random Graphs for Analysis
I will generate the random graphs using the generate_partial_clique() function. This function creates an adjacency matrix representing a graph with n nodes. A fraction of these nodes form a clique with a given edge density. For example, setting clique_fraction = 0.5 and clique_edge_density = 0.95 means that 50% of the nodes form a clique where 95% of the possible edges within the clique are present. This function allows us to control the size and density of the clique, making it useful for studying how different graph structures affect the performance of various algorithms.

2. Varying the Random Graphs
In my simulation study, I will vary the number of nodes (n) and the clique edge density (clique_edge_density). Specifically, I will analyze two levels of n: 30 and 50. For each level of n, I will test two levels of clique_edge_density: 0.85 and 0.95. This variation will allow me to study how the size and density of the graph impact the performance of the algorithms.

3. Methods Used in the Simulation Study
I will use all 25 implementations of the compute_maximal_partial_clique function. Each method will be used on every adjacency matrix generated in the simulation study. The compute_maximal_partial_clique_master() function will be used to manage these implementations, ensuring consistency and proper timing controls.

4. Goals of the Simulation Study
The primary goal of this simulation study is to understand the performance of different compute_maximal_partial_clique implementations under varying conditions of graph size and density. Specifically, I aim to:

Determine how often each method finds the maximal partial clique.
Compare the performance (success rate and execution time) of the methods across different graph structures.
Identify any trends or patterns in the performance of the methods as the graph size and density change.
5. Number of Trials per Level
For each combination of n and clique_edge_density, I will run 10 trials. This should provide enough data to observe trends and make meaningful comparisons between the different implementations.

6. Estimated Time for the Simulation Study
Given the constraints and requirements:

Number of levels for n: 2 (30 and 50)
Number of levels for clique_edge_density: 2 (0.85 and 0.95)
Number of trials per level: 10
Number of methods: 25
Maximum time per method per trial: 30 seconds
The total number of problem instances is:
2×2×10×25=1000

The maximum estimated time is: 
1000 × 30 seconds= 30000 seconds ≈ 8.3hours

Given the constraint to keep the simulation study under 5 hours, I will either reduce the number of trials per level or decrease the time_limit from 30 seconds to a smaller value (e.g., 15 seconds) to ensure the study runs within the allowed time.

Summary of the Simulation Plan
Random Graph Generation: Using generate_partial_clique() with varying n and clique_edge_density.
Levels:
n: 30 and 50
clique_edge_density: 0.85 and 0.95
Methods: All 25 implementations of compute_maximal_partial_clique.
Goals: Assess success rate and execution time of each method, identify trends across different graph structures.
Trials per Level: 10 trials.
Maximum Time: Adjusted to ensure the simulation completes within 5 hours, potentially reducing the time limit for each trial.

Q4:

For my final project, I plan to create a PkgDown website for the UWBiost561 package. This package will include functions related to the analysis and simulation of partial cliques in random graphs. The package will have the following components:

Functions: generate_partial_clique: Generates random graphs with a specified fraction of nodes forming a partial clique.
compute_maximal_partial_clique_master: Finds the maximal partial clique using various implementations.
run_simulation: Performs a simulation study to evaluate the performance of different maximal partial clique implementations.

Documentation: Comprehensive documentation for each exported function, including descriptions of inputs, outputs, and examples of usage.

Vignette: A vignette that demonstrates how to use the package functions, including generating random graphs, finding maximal partial cliques, and performing a small simulation study.

README: A README file that explains the purpose of the package, provides installation instructions, and includes links to the GitHub repository and PkgDown website.
